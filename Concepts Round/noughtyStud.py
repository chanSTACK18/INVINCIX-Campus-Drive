""" 
A class room is infamous for naughty students. The principal had asked their class teacher to note
down names of the candidates that are caught disturbing during a class. At the end of every month,
the principal would want to see the naughtiest candidate by looking at who’s name has occurred in
the list the highest number of times. Also the principal would like to know if any one is doing better
and would want to know who’s the least naughty.
Write a program that can tell the principal both the least and the most naughty candidate in the list.
